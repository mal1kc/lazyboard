1. dont plug before starting uploading

   in this chip we need to start uploading then plug device because after some time device can't be flashed

2. Warning: device with unknown new version of Micronucleus detected.

   see [[https://github.com/micronucleus/micronucleus/issues/130][github micronucleus issue]]

   solutin from [[https://digistump.com/board/index.php/topic,1834.msg13109.html#msg13109][solution from digistump forum]]
    #+begin_example
    1. clone the source code for micronucleus from https://github.com/micronucleus/micronucleus
    2. cd to directory named 'commandline'
    3. ran the 'make' command to compile the micronucleus executable
      - if encounter error about 'lib-usb' make sure your system have it if still error continues edit 'makefile' ; comment out 'STATIC = ..'
    4. He then copied the resulting executable to his /home/username/.arduino15/packages/digistump/tools/micronucleus directory, renaming the old file first
    5. And then tested it to make sure it worked as expected
    6. if you are encountering udev rules error
     - copy '49-micronucleus.rules to'  '/etc/udev/rules.d/'
    #+end_example

    #+RESULTS:
